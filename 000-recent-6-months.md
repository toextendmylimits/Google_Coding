## Graph BFS/DFS
1. Whether a word can be typed from a keyboard
  Given a 2D keyboard, and a “maximum jump distance” jump_distance, determine if a given word can be constructed using the characters in the keyboard, obeying the jump_distance. A jump can be up, down, right, or left. But NO diagonal, i.e. a diagonal jump would naturally consume 2 units of jump distance.
