    Should practice BFS as well apart from DFS.
   
1. [2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries](https://leetcode.com/problems/height-of-binary-tree-after-subtree-removal-queries)  
  The idea is for a node, the max depth without that code is either from left or right subtree. So have two hash maps, key is node val, one hash map is to store the max depth without a code when performing preorder traversal from left, the other is for max depth without the node when performing preorder traversal from right. When doing preorder traversal from left, assign the max depth to the node, and then if current depth is larger than max depth, then update max depth. Then traverse left subtreee and right subtree.

      ```python
     def treeQueries(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
          maxDepthLeft = 0
          maxDepthRight = 0
          nodeMaxDepthLeftMap = {}
          nodeMaxDepthRightMap = {}
          def preorderFromLeft(root, depth):
              nonlocal maxDepthLeft, nodeMaxDepthLeftMap
              if not root:
                  return
              nodeMaxDepthLeftMap[root.val] = maxDepthLeft
              maxDepthLeft = max(maxDepthLeft, depth)
              preorderFromLeft(root.left, depth + 1)
              preorderFromLeft(root.right, depth + 1)
          
          def preorderFromRight(root, depth):
              nonlocal maxDepthRight, nodeMaxDepthRightMap
              if not root:
                  return
              
              nodeMaxDepthRightMap[root.val] = maxDepthRight
              maxDepthRight = max(maxDepthRight, depth)
              preorderFromRight(root.right, depth + 1)
              preorderFromRight(root.left, depth + 1)
  
          preorderFromLeft(root, 0)
          preorderFromRight(root, 0)
  
          result = []
          for query in queries:

1. [1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-nodes-and-return-forest)  
   Key observation is that if a node's parent is deleted, and the node is not deleted, then it would be part of the result. If a node is part of the result, then we also need to know its children as well.

   So the idea is to have a recursive function, which has two parameters, one is the node to be processed, the other is whether the node's parent is deleted, and the return value is the node after remving nodes that should be deleted. In each recursion call,  
    1. If node is null, return null simply  
    1. If node should be deleted but its parent is not deleted, add it to result  
    1. Let node's child know whether the node is deleted, and remove relevant nodes from its child   
    1. If node is deleted return Null otherwise return the node  

    <details>
  
      ```python
   def delNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        nodes_to_delete = set(to_delete)
        result = []
        def dfs(root, is_parent_deleted):
            if not root:
                return root
            
            is_deleted = root.val in nodes_to_delete
            if is_parent_deleted and not is_deleted:
                result.append(root)
            
            root.left = dfs(root.left, is_deleted)
            root.right = dfs(root.right, is_deleted)
            return None if is_deleted else root
        dfs(root, True)
        return result
      ```

1. [366. Find Leaves of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-leaves-of-binary-tree)  
  The intuition is that the result is the list of nodes with same height. So use a hash map to store the list of nodes for different height. The tree's height can be calculated recursively. In each recursion call, add a node to the list of nodes which have same height.  

    <details>
  
      ```python
    def findLeaves(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        heightNodesMap = defaultdict(list)

        def getHeight(root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            
            currHeight = max(getHeight(root.left), getHeight(root.right)) + 1
            heightNodesMap[currHeight].append(root.val)
            return currHeight
        
        return [heightNodesMap[height] for height in range(1, getHeight(root) + 1)]
      ```

1. [2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-nodes-equal-to-average-of-subtree)  
    The idea is to calucate a tree's nodes count and sum recursively.   
    1. If root is null, the both the nodes count and sum is 0  
    1. Otherwise get nodes count and sum for left subtree and right subtree respectively  
    1. Then the nodes count is the total nodes count of both subtrees plus 1  
    1. The sum is the sum of both subtrees plus root value  
    1. If root val equals to average subtree value, then update global variable result  
    1. In the end return nodes count and sum of current tree  

    <details>
  
      ```python
   def averageOfSubtree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        result = 0
        def getNodesCountAndSum(root):
            nonlocal result
            if not root:
                return (0, 0)
            
            leftCount, leftSum = getNodesCountAndSum(root.left)
            rightCount, rightSum = getNodesCountAndSum(root.right)
            currCount = leftCount + rightCount + 1
            currSum = leftSum + rightSum + root.val

            if root.val == currSum // currCount:
                result += 1
            return (currCount, currSum)
        
        getNodesCountAndSum(root)
        return result

    Serizalize tree and store it in hash table  
1. [897. Increasing Order Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-order-search-tree)  
    Approach 1 is to first get all node values using inorder traversal, then create a new Linked List.     
   
    Approach 2 is when doing inorder traversal, connect nodes as well. Set left to null, connect current node to root, then advance current.   

    <details>
  
      ```python
      # Approach 1
    def increasingBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        result = []
        def inorder(root):
            if not root:
                return
            inorder(root.left)
            result.append(root.val)
            inorder(root.right)
        
        inorder(root)
        curr = dummyHead = TreeNode()
        for n in result:
            curr.right = TreeNode(n)
            curr = curr.right
        
        return dummyHead.right

      # Approach 2
    def increasingBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        curr = dummyHead = TreeNode()
        def inorder(root):
            nonlocal curr
            if not root:
                return
            inorder(root.left)
            root.left = None
            curr.right = root
            curr = curr.right
            inorder(root.right)
        
        inorder(root)     
        return dummyHead.right

## Heap
1. [2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://leetcode.com/problems/meeting-rooms-iii)  
    Key observation is that when multiple rooms are available, the room with smallest index should be picked so good candidate for a min heap. And when there is no room available, a meeting should be delayed until a room is available, i.e. the meeting in that room finishes, and the room that has meeting that finishes first should be picked. so good idea to use another mean heap.  
    1. The idea is to sort meetings based on start time and end time, then do a linear scan of the meetings. 
    1. For a start time, release all the meetings that have finished, i.e. finish time <= start time. Then if there are free meeting rooms, pick the room with the smallest index, and push to the heap of ending time and room index
    1. Else means no room is free, so the meeting need to be delayed. Pick a meeting that finishes earlist to get the new start time and free room. Push the expected end time and room to the heap.

      ```python
    def mostBooked(self, n: int, meetings: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        freeRooms = [r for r in range(n)]
        busyRooms = []
        result = [0] * n
        for start, end in sorted(meetings):
            while busyRooms and busyRooms[0][0] <= start:
                endTime, room = heapq.heappop(busyRooms)
                heapq.heappush(freeRooms, room)
            
            if freeRooms:
                room = heapq.heappop(freeRooms)
                heapq.heappush(busyRooms, [end, room])
            else:
