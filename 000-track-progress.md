| ---------------------- | ------------- |  ---------------- | -------------  | ------------- | 
|[643. Maximum Average Subarray I](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-average-subarray-i) | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11 | YES | Beware loop boundary |  
|[209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum) | Sliding Window |  16/11, 17/11 | YES | Beware loop condition >= and return value|
|[713. Subarray Product Less Than K](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k)  | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11 | YES | Beware check if k <= 1, return 0. Also update result with right - left + 1 which represent continuous subarrays that end with index right |  
|[159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-two-distinct-characters) | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11 | NO | Got it right easily, no need to practice
| [904. Fruit Into Baskets](https://leetcode.com/problems/fruit-into-baskets) | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11| YES | Need to be 100% clear
|[992. Subarrays with K Different Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/subarrays-with-k-different-integers) | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11 | YES | Still difficult. Need to conver to at most k, and in which update result with right - left + 1 meaning subarrays ending at right | 
|[76. Minimum Window Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring) | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11| YES | Beware check matches in while loop |
|[438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string) | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11| YES | Same as above, need more practice 
|[424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement) | Sliding Window | 16/11, 17/11 | YES | very difficult
|[239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum) | Deque/Stack | 16/11, 17/11| YES | Very difficult
|[56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/) | Merge Interval | 16/11, 17/11| YES | Should be even more familiar
|[57. Insert Interval](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/) | Merge Interval  | 16/11, 17/11| YES | Git it wrong, practice again
|[759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time) | Merge Interval | 16/11, 17/11| YES | Feels not very clear, and the approach is not optimal
|[986. Interval List Intersections](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-list-intersections)  | Merge Interval | 17/11 | YES | Not 100% clear, beware to discard interval with smaller ending time after each comparison|
